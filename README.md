## Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

You will be able to use this data to assess the following: 
* district summary
* school summary
* highest performing schools by % overall passing
* lowest performing schools by % overall passing
* math scores by grade
* reading scores by grade
* scores by school spending
* scores by school size
* scores by school type
